# **Guitar Site Redesign**

Welcome to my guitar website redesign!

This project is built from scratch off of [a previous project of the same name](https://github.com/Jayden-Doll/GuitarSite).

It is a total and dramatic overhaul of the old site, all with some cool functionality to seal the whole thing together.

You can visit it [here](https://jayden-doll.github.io/GuitarSite-Redesign/).
